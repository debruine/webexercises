```{r setup, include = FALSE}

)
library(webexercises)
```


The goal of `{webexercises}` is to enable instructors to easily create interactive web pages that students can use in self-guided learning. Although `{webexercises}` has fewer features than RStudio's [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package, it is more lightweight: whereas `{learnr}` tutorials must be either hosted on a shiny server or run locally, `{webexercises}` creates standalone HTML files that require only a JavaScript-enabled browser. It is also extremely simple to use.

## Installation

You can install `{webexercises}` from CRAN using:

```{r install-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("webexercises")
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webexercises) with:

```{r install-webexercises, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("psyteachr/webexercises")
```

## Creating interactive widgets with inline code

The webexercises package provides functions that create HTML widgets using [inline R code](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).  These functions are:

| function                | widget         | description                    |
|:------------------------|:---------------|:-------------------------------|
| `fitb()`                | text box       | fill-in-the-blank question     |
| `mcq()`                 | pull-down menu | multiple choice question       |
| `torf()`                | pull-down menu | TRUE or FALSE question         |
| `longmcq()`             | radio buttons  | MCQs with long answers         |
| `hide()` and `unhide()` | button         | solution revealed when clicked |
| `total_correct()`       | text           | updating total correct         |

The appearance of the text box and pull-down menu widgets changes when users enter the correct answer. Answers can be either static or dynamic (i.e., specified using R code). Widget styles can be changed using `style_widgets()`.

Examples are provided in the **Web Exercises** R Markdown template. To create a file from the webexercises template in RStudio, click `File -> New File... -> RMarkdown` and in the dialog box that appears, select `From Template` and choose `Web Exercises`.

Alternatively (or if you're not using RStudio) use:

```{r compile-webexercises, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("exercises.Rmd", "webexercises", "webexercises")
```

Knit the file to HTML to see how it works. **Note: The widgets only function in a JavaScript-enabled browser.**

These functions are optimised to be used with inline r code, but you can also use them in code chunks by setting the chunk option `results = 'asis'` and using `cat()` to display the result of the widget. 

```{r, results = 'asis'}
# echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'
opts <- c("install.package", 
            "install.packages", 
            answer = "library", 
            "libraries")

q1 <- mcq(opts)

cat("What function loads a package that is already on your computer?", q1)
```


### Total Correct 

The function `total_correct()` displays a running total of correct responses. Change the `elem` argument to display in a different style (e.g., `h2` or `h3` for header styles). If you're comfortable with css styles or classes, you can add them with the `args` argument. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
total_correct(elem = "h3", args = "style='color:#003366;'")
```

`r total_correct(elem = "h3", args = "style='color:#003366;'")`

### Fill-In-The-Blanks

Create fill-in-the-blank questions using `fitb()`, providing the answer as the first argument.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitb(4)
```

- 2 + 2 is `r fitb(4)`

You can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session (e.g., in a hidden code chunk).

```{r echo = TRUE}
x <- sample(2:8, 1)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitb(x)
```

- The square root of `r x^2` is: `r fitb(x)`



The blanks are case-sensitive; if you don't care about case, use the argument `ignore_case = TRUE`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitb("E", ignore_case = TRUE)
```

- What is the letter after D? `r fitb("E", ignore_case = TRUE)`



If you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument `ignore_ws = TRUE` (which is the default) and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable.

```{r eval = FALSE}
fitb(c("library( tidyverse )", "library( \"tidyverse\" )", "library( 'tidyverse' )"), ignore_ws = TRUE, width = "20")
```

- How do you load the tidyverse package? `r fitb(c("library( tidyverse )", "library( \"tidyverse\" )", "library( 'tidyverse' )"), ignore_ws = TRUE, width = "20")`

You can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitb(c("A", "E", "I", "O" , "U"), ignore_case = TRUE)
```

- Type a vowel: `r fitb(c("A", "E", "I", "O" , "U"), ignore_case = TRUE)`

You can use regular expressions to test answers against more complex rules.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitb("^[a-zA-Z]{3}$", width = 3, regex = TRUE)
```

- Type any 3 letters: `r fitb("^[a-zA-Z]{3}$", width = 3, regex = TRUE)`

### Multiple Choice

Set up a multiple-choice drop-down menu using `mcq()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mcq(c("tidyr", "dplyr", answer = "readr", "ggplot2"))
```

- What package helps you load CSV files? `r mcq(c("tidyr", "dplyr", answer = "readr", "ggplot2"))`
- "Never gonna give you up, never gonna: `r mcq(c("let you go", "turn you down", "run away", answer = "let you down"))`"
- "I `r mcq(c(answer = "bless the rains", "guess it rains", "sense the rain"))` down in Africa" -Toto

### True or False

Make quick true/false questions with `torf()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
torf(TRUE)
torf(FALSE)
```

- True or False? You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`. `r torf(TRUE)`

### Longer MCQs

When your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use `longmcq()` to deal with this. Since the answers are long, It's probably best to set up the options inside an R chunk with `echo=FALSE`. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
opts_p <- c(
   "the probability that the null hypothesis is true",
   answer = "the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true",
   "the probability of making an error in your conclusion"
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
longmcq(opts_p)
```

**What is a p-value?**

`r longmcq(opts_p)`

**What is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# use sample() to randomise the order
opts_ci <- sample(c(
  answer = "if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean",
  "there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range",
  "95% of the data fall within this range"
))
```

`r longmcq(opts_ci)`

### Hidden solutions and hints

You can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button using `hide()` before the solution and `unhide()` after, each as inline R code.  Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the `hide()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
hide("Click here to see the solution")
unhide()
```

If the solution is an RMarkdown code chunk, instead of using `hide()` and `unhide()`, you can set the `webex.hide` chunk option to TRUE, or set it to the string you wish to display on the button.

How do you load tidyverse?

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")`

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

`r unhide()`

## Bookdown

You can add webexercises to a bookdown project or start a new bookdown project using `add_to_bookdown()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create a new book
# use default includes and scripts directories (include and R)
add_to_bookdown(bookdown_dir = "demo_bs4",
                output_format = "bs4_book",
                render = TRUE)

add_to_bookdown(bookdown_dir = "demo_git",
                output_format = "gitbook",
                render = TRUE)

add_to_bookdown(bookdown_dir = "demo_html",
                output_format = "html_book",
                render = TRUE)

add_to_bookdown(bookdown_dir = "demo_tufte",
                output_format = "tufte_html_book",
                render = TRUE)

# update an existing book with custom include and script directories
add_to_bookdown(bookdown_dir = ".",
                include_dir = "www",
                script_dir = "scripts",
                output_format = "gitbook")
```

## Learnr syntax

You can use learnr syntax to set up webexercises, too. 

```{r, results='asis'}
quiz(caption = "Learnr Syntax Examples",
  # fitb: a single true answer
  question("2 + 2 is",
           answer(4, TRUE)),
  # multi-answer: set type explicitly
  question("Type a vowel:",
           type = "learnr_text",
           answer("A", TRUE),
           answer("E", TRUE),
           answer("I", TRUE),
           answer("O", TRUE),
           answer("U", TRUE),
           options = list(ignore_case = TRUE)),
  # mcq: short answers (charlength <= 50)
  question("Never gonna give you up, never gonna:",
           answer("let you go"), 
           answer("turn you down"), 
           answer("run away"), 
           answer("let you down", TRUE),
           random_answer_order = TRUE),
  # longmcq: longer answers (charlength > 50)
  question("What is a p-value?",
           answer("the probability that the null hypothesis is true"),
           answer("the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true", TRUE),
           answer("the probability of making an error in your conclusion"))
)
```
